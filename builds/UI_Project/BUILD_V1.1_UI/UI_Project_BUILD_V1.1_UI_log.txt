[ERROR]
Code:7
LabVIEW cannot find a file that is a dependency of a Startup, Exported, or Always Included VI.

File Not Found: C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2018\user.lib\LumencorDLL32\VIs\lm Assign LE Colors.vi

The missing file might be referenced by one of the libraries included in the build or by the file - V1.1_UI.vi. To fix this issue:

- Open all Startup, Exported, or Always Included VIs, recompile them (CTRL+SHIFT Click the Run arrow) and save them to update their dependencies.
- Open all libraries included in the build and verify the existence and locations of referenced files. Also, try building with the additional exclusion option, "Remove unused members of project libraries", checked.
