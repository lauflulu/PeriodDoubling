CRUCIAL

- Review Time Calculation procedure
  + Timing of physical change
  DONE Timing of pumps
   - SingleRing:
		- Feed: 6-7 ms per Valve Action Step
		- Pump: 
  DONE Duration for light source availability
  + Transfer Timing and Process Finish Events/Handlers
- Queue for continuous loop still buggy

- Adjust Jogsens with objective
- Limit z-Movement with Objective

- Adapt everything for Maerkl reactor
- Handle the Camera Events properly (Performance enhancing):
	Make a dynamic event (LV), register it (LV). Make an event case for it (LV). Then, create the event handle (dll) and start a dynamic vi (LV) that waits for it (dll). When it's done, trigger the event (generate user event).

IDEA
- Correct PDMS angle in camera pictures and implement it also in the Stage movement
